# Dotfiles
Various configuration files for my custom hyprland desktop on Arch.

Based off https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland

Profiles are based off both my laptop and desktop, so the individual config files are slightly different between devices.

Generally you should use the `xps15` ones, as they are the on the system I use most frequently and are the most up-to-date.
